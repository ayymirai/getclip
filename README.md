# getclip
Ultra simple win32 program to read text from clipboard and output it to stdout

Reading the clipboard cannot be done in simple Windows batch files, only with PowerShell or something similar.

getclip addresses this problem.

Simply compile it with mingw-gcc, not additional parameters, makefile, etc needed.
